## About The Resource
This script is a powerful resource that makes your life easier!
It allows you to create as many "safe zones" as you want with different configurations.
It is optimized as much as possible and is easily editable visit the documentation to understand it better!

## Features
Explore the possibilities and tailor your server experience with these powerful features:

* <strong>Collision Management</strong>: Enable/Disable collisions between peds and vehicles, or both, as per your server's requirements.
* <strong>AFK Handling</strong>: Implement an AFK system with customizable notifications, allowing players to stay engaged or face automatic kick after specified AFK duration in the safezone.
* <strong>Combat Restrictions</strong>: Empower server owners to enable/disable player punching and shooting within the safezone, fostering a controlled environment for interactions.
* <strong>Speed Limit Control</strong>: Set a maximum vehicle speed within the safezone (in mph or km/h), promoting safer driving experiences.
* <strong>Jumping Control</strong>: Decide whether players can jump inside the safezone, adding realism and context to their actions.
* <strong>Weapon Management</strong>: Flexibly control the ability to equip any weapon while inside the safezone, providing a tailored roleplay experience.
* <strong>Vehicle Management</strong>: Grant or revoke the privilege of using vehicles within the safezone, allowing fine-tuned gameplay control.
* <strong>Player Activity Log</strong>: Keep track of player entries and exits within the safezone with server-side logging.
* <strong>In-Game Notifications</strong>: Inform players when they enter or exit a safezone, enhancing their immersion and awareness.
* <strong>As many zones as you want</strong>: You can create as many zones as you want, where you want and with the settings you want. In fact, you will be able to define the types of zones and subsequently the positions of the zones with their own typology.
